    <p>With Ares' direct, unholy blessing, Hercules becomes an unstoppable engine of war. <br> Troy falls in a matter of days, the city walls crumbling under a power fueled by divine wrath. <br> Hercules's sheer, overwhelming might and the terror he inspires in his enemies end the war quickly, saving countless Greek lives. <br> The other gods are horrified and disgusted by the bloodshed, but cannot deny the decisive victory. <br> Hercules returns a conqueror, but not a hero. <br> He rules over a new, powerful kingdom, but it is built on fear, not respect. <br> He is a king of immense power, but his reign is cold and brutal, and he and his kingdom are forever associated with the slaughter of Troy.</p>
