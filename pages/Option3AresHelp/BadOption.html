<h1>The Puppet of War</h1>

    <p>Hercules accepts Ares's help, but the god's influence is more insidious than he imagined. Ares revels in the slaughter and begins to corrupt Hercules, twisting his righteous fury into bloodlust. Hercules becomes a monstrous parody of his former self, a vessel for Ares's violent will. He slaughters friend and foe alike, his actions becoming so heinous that even the Greeks turn against him. Ultimately, his divine-fueled rage consumes him, and he becomes nothing more than Ares's puppet, a symbol of unchecked war and brutality. The other gods intervene to stop the carnage, but Hercules is destroyed in the process, and his name is forever reviled by both mortals and gods as a warning against the corrupting nature of absolute power.</p>
