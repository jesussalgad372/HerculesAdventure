    <h1>The Puppet of War</h1>
<body>
    <div class="Container">
    <div class="story" >
    <p>Hercules accepts Ares's help, but the god's influence is more insidious than he imagined. <br> Ares revels in the slaughter and begins to corrupt Hercules, twisting his righteous fury into bloodlust. <br> Hercules becomes a monstrous parody of his former self, a vessel for Ares's violent will. <br> He slaughters friend and foe alike, his actions becoming so heinous that even the Greeks turn against him. <br> Ultimately, his divine-fueled rage consumes him, and he becomes nothing more than Ares's puppet, a symbol of unchecked war and brutality. <br> The other gods intervene to stop the carnage, but Hercules is destroyed in the process, <br> and his name is forever reviled by both mortals and gods as a warning against the corrupting nature of absolute power.</p>
