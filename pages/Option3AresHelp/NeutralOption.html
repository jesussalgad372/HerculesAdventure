    <p>Ares grants Hercules his strength, and the Trojan War is won with a terrifying speed and efficiency. <br> But the cost is immense. <br> Ares demands an exorbitant price for his divine aid, extracting tribute from Hercules and his followers for years to come. <br> The war's end brings no joy, only a crushing sense of emptiness and loss. <br> The Greeks return victorious but are morally and spiritually wounded by the level of violence and destruction. <br> Hercules, though powerful and respected, is forever changed by his deal with the god of war. <br> He is a living testament to the truth that some victories are not worth the price paid. <br> His fame is great, but it is a bitter and somber fame, and he finds no true peace or happiness in his remaining years.</p>
