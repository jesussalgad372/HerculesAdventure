    <p>Unwilling to be a pawn of kings, and with a lingering distrust of the other Olympian gods after his many trials, Hercules decides to take matters into his own hands.<br>
    He journeys to the battlefield and, in a moment of reckless desperation, calls upon the aid of <b><i>Ares</i></b>, the brutal and unpredictable god of war.<br>
    <b><i>Ares</i></b>, a divine being who is more focused on bloodshed and chaos than strategy, answers the summons â€” <b>but his help comes at a terrible price.</b></p>
