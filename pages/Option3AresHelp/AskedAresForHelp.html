        Unwilling to be a pawn of kings, <br />
        and with a lingering distrust of the other Olympian gods after his many
        trials, <br />
        Hercules decides to take matters into his own hands. <br />
        He journeys to the battlefield and, <br />
        in a moment of reckless desperation, <br />
        calls upon the aid of Ares, the brutal and unpredictable god of war.
        <br />
        Ares, a divine being who is more focused on bloodshed and chaos than
        strategy, <br />
        answers the summons — but his help comes at a terrible price.
