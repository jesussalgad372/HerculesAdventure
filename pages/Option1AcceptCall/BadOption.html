    <h1>The Tragic Fall</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Consumed by the rage and brutality of war, Hercules relies on brute force for every challenge. He ignores the counsel of his allies and, in the final sack of Troy, allows the temples to be desecrated, believing his power makes him immune to the gods' wrath. As the Greek fleet returns home, a terrible storm sent by the angry gods wrecks the ships. Hercules, unable to fight the divine fury, is cast out of favor and forced to wander alone. His glorious reputation is ruined, and he dies a lonely, bitter man, tormented by the memory of the destruction he caused.</p>
