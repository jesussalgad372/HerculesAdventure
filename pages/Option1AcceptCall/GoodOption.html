    <p>During the long war, Hercules's choices are guided by wisdom and compassion. He uses the lessons of his labors not just for fighting, but for saving lives. He counsels against brutality and, during the final sack of Troy, prevents the desecration of the temples. Because of his virtuous conduct, the gods, especially <em>Athena</em>, are pleased. He returns home a true hero, respected for his virtue as much as for his strength. He and his family are granted a long, peaceful, and prosperous life, and his story becomes a legend not just of power, but of honor.</p>
