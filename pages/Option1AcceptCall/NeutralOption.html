Hercules fights valiantly, his feats of strength helping to secure the <em>Greek victory</em>. He achieves glory and success, but not without compromise. He is a warrior first and foremost, and the chaos of the war leaves a trail of destruction in its wake. Though he prevents some tragedies, he cannot stop them all. He returns home a celebrated hero, but his victory feels hollow. The journey home is difficult, and he is forever troubled by the things he witnessed. He is a legend, but one whose fame came at a heavy price, leaving him with a sense of regret that shadows his final days.</p>
