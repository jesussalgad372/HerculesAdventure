            <p>Hercules tries to find peace, but the war haunts him. He is tormented by guilt and regret, wondering if his presence could have saved lives. He hears of the death of heroes and the destruction of Troy and feels impotent and useless. His inaction consumes him, and he falls back into a rage-filled bitterness. He dies a lonely and tormented man, his final years a stark contrast to his heroic deeds. The ghosts of the people he could have saved become his personal torment, a hell of his own making.</p>
