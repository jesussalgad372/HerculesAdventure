            <p>Hercules lives a quiet life, a former legend who chose to stay home for the defining conflict of his age. His choice has an unforeseen consequence; a new, more ruthless hero rises to prominence in his place, and a new era of politics and power struggles begins. Hercules, while he avoids the tragedy that befalls the returning Greeks, is a passive observer of the changing world. He lives in peace, but his legacy is irrevocably altered. He is remembered as a great hero of the past, but one who chose to be absent when he was needed most.</p>
