            <p>After the messenger leaves, Hercules finds a new kind of heroism. He dedicates his life to his family and his community, using his wisdom and experience to counsel others and prevent conflicts. He hears of the Trojan War from afar and the tragic fate of many heroes. He comes to believe his decision was the correct one, as it allowed him to find true peace. He lives a long, happy life, remembered for his wisdom and self-control, having proved that his greatest strength was his ability to choose his own destiny.</p>
