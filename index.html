    <P>After the long torment of his twelve labors, <strong>Hercules</strong> lived at last in hard won peace. The clamor of monsters and tyrants had faded; for a time, the world needed him no longer. But peace is never eternal for one born of gods and destiny.<br>
One day, beneath a sun heavy with prophecy, a messenger from King Agamemnon arrived. He brought word of an outrage Helen, the queen of Sparta, carried off to Troy  and a call to arms. <em>The hosts gather for vengeance,” </em>the messenger said. <em>“The Achaeans need their greatest champion. Will you fight?”</em>
Before answering, Hercules stood long in silence. He saw two paths stretching before him — <strong>one toward glory, the other toward peace. But a third, darker path lingered at the edge of his thoughts,</strong> one that defied both mortal and divine will.<br>
The air seemed to thicken as he pondered. He had fought for kings, slain beasts at the god'scommand, and endured agonies meant to break mortals. Each deed carved a deeper mark upon his soul. He thought of the faces he had lost, the blood that never truly washed away.
Duty whispered in one ear — the call of heroism, the echo of his legend binding him to fate. In the other, a softer voice spoke of rest, of a life finally lived for himself. Yet beneath them both, a third voice stirred — darker, primal the part of him that remembered strength untamed and wrath divine. The power that had once split mountains still slept within his veins, and its hunger was not easily silenced.<br>
He stepped outside, staring at the horizon where war already burned unseen. The wind carried the scent of smoke and salt, as if the world dared him to choose. In the distance, thunder rolled or was it a god's laughter, waiting to see which path the son of Zeus would take?<br>
Three destinies awaited him: to fight for men, to turn away, or to grasp the hand of war itself.</P><br>


<ol>
    <li>Accept the call to war</li>
    <p>Hercules, remembering his duty and the glory of his past, chooses to accept the call. He sees the cause as just and the opportunity to use his immense strength for a noble purpose. He bids farewell to his family and sets out for the shores of Troy, ready for battle.</p>
    
    <li>Refuse the call, citing your long history of suffering for others</li>
    <p>Hercules, weary from a lifetime of being used by gods and kings, declines the messenger's request. He cites his long history of suffering and decides he will no longer be a pawn in the affairs of mortals. He chooses to prioritize his own peace and the well-being of his family.</p>
    <li>Take god Ares' help</li>
    <p>Unwilling to be a pawn of kings, and with a lingering distrust of the other Olympian gods after his many trials, Hercules decides to take matters into his own hands. He journeys to the battlefield and, in a moment of reckless desperation, calls upon the aid of Ares, the brutal and unpredictable god of war. Ares, a divine being who is more focused on bloodshed and chaos than strategy, answers the summons, but his help comes at a terrible price.</p>
