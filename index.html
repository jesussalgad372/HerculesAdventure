          After the long torment of his twelve labors,
          <strong>Hercules</strong> lived at last in hard won peace. <br> The clamor
          of monsters and tyrants had faded; for a time, the world needed him no
          longer. <br> But peace is never eternal for one born of gods and
          destiny.<br />
          One day, beneath a sun heavy with prophecy, a messenger from King
          Agamemnon arrived. <br> He brought word of an outrage Helen, the queen of
          Sparta, carried off to Troy and a call to arms. <br>
          <em>The hosts gather for vengeance,” </em>the messenger said. <br>
          <em>“The Achaeans need their greatest champion. <b> <br> Will you fight?”</em> </b> <br>
          Before answering, Hercules stood long in silence. <br> He saw two paths
          stretching before him — <br>
          <strong
            >one toward glory, the other toward peace, but a third and darker path
            lingered at the edge of his thoughts,</strong
          > <br>
          <strong>one that defied both mortal and divine will.<br /> </strong>
          The air seemed to thicken as he pondered. <br> He had fought for kings,
          slain beasts at the god's command, and endured agonies meant to break
          mortals. <br> Each deed carved a deeper mark upon his soul. <br> He thought of
          the faces he had lost, the blood that never truly washed away. <br> Duty
          whispered in one ear — the call of heroism, the echo of his legend
          binding him to fate. <br> In the other, a softer voice spoke of rest, of a
          life finally lived for himself. <br> Yet beneath them both, a third voice
          stirred — darker, primal the part of him that remembered strength
          untamed and wrath divine. <br> The power that had once split mountains
          still slept within his veins, and its hunger was not easily
          silenced.<br />
          He stepped outside, staring at the horizon where war already burned
          unseen. <br> The wind carried the scent of smoke and salt, as if the world
          dared him to choose. <br> In the distance, thunder rolled or was it a god's
          laughter, waiting to see which path the son of Zeus would take?<br />

    <!-- <ol>
    <li>Accept the call to war</li>
    <p>Hercules, remembering his duty and the glory of his past, chooses to accept the call. He sees the cause as just and the opportunity to use his immense strength for a noble purpose. He bids farewell to his family and sets out for the shores of Troy, ready for battle.</p>
    
    <li>Refuse the call, citing your long history of suffering for others</li>
    <p>Hercules, weary from a lifetime of being used by gods and kings, declines the messenger's request. He cites his long history of suffering and decides he will no longer be a pawn in the affairs of mortals. He chooses to prioritize his own peace and the well-being of his family.</p>
    <li>Take god Ares' help</li>
    <p>Unwilling to be a pawn of kings, and with a lingering distrust of the other Olympian gods after his many trials, Hercules decides to take matters into his own hands. He journeys to the battlefield and, in a moment of reckless desperation, calls upon the aid of Ares, the brutal and unpredictable god of war. Ares, a divine being who is more focused on bloodshed and chaos than strategy, answers the summons, but his help comes at a terrible price.</p>
