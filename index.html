    <P>After the long torment of his twelve labors, <strong>Hercules</strong> lived at last in hard won peace. 
    <br>The clamor of monsters and tyrants had faded; for a time, the world needed him no longer. But peace is never eternal for one born of gods and destiny.<br>
    One day, beneath a sun heavy with prophecy, a messenger from King Agamemnon arrived. He brought word of an outrage <br>Helen, the queen of Sparta, carried off to Troy  and a call to arms. <em>The hosts gather for vengeance,” </em>the messenger said. <br> <em>“The Achaeans need their greatest champion. Will you fight?”</em>
    Before answering, Hercules stood long in silence. <br> He saw two paths stretching before him — <strong>one toward glory, the other toward peace. <br> But a third, darker path lingered at the edge of his thoughts,</strong> one that defied both mortal and divine will.<br>
    The air seemed to thicken as he pondered. He had fought for kings, slain beasts <br> at the god'scommand, and endured agonies meant to break mortals. Each deed carved a deeper mark upon his soul. He thought of the faces <br> he had lost, the blood that never truly washed away.
    Duty whispered in one ear — the call of heroism, the echo of his legend binding him to fate. <br> In the other, a softer voice spoke of rest, of a life finally lived for himself. Yet beneath them both, a third voice stirred — darker, primal the part of <br>  him that remembered strength untamed and wrath divine. The power that had once split mountains still slept within his veins, and its hunger was not easily silenced.<br>
    He stepped outside, staring at the horizon where war already burned unseen. <br> The wind carried the scent of smoke and salt, as if the world dared him to choose. In the distance, thunder rolled or was it a god's laughter, <br> waiting to see which path the son of Zeus would take?<br>
    <h2>Three destinies awaited him:</h2><h3><a class="Gold" href="/pages/Option1AcceptCall/AcceptedCall.html">To fight for men?</a></h3> <h3><a class="red" href="/pages/Option2RefuseCall/RefusedCall.html">To turn away?</a></h3> <h3><a class="blue" href="/pages/Option3AresHelp/AskedAresForHelp.html">To ask Are's for help?</a></h3><br>

<!-- <ol>
    <li>Accept the call to war</li>
    <p>Hercules, remembering his duty and the glory of his past, chooses to accept the call. He sees the cause as just and the opportunity to use his immense strength for a noble purpose. He bids farewell to his family and sets out for the shores of Troy, ready for battle.</p>
    
    <li>Refuse the call, citing your long history of suffering for others</li>
    <p>Hercules, weary from a lifetime of being used by gods and kings, declines the messenger's request. He cites his long history of suffering and decides he will no longer be a pawn in the affairs of mortals. He chooses to prioritize his own peace and the well-being of his family.</p>
    <li>Take god Ares' help</li>
    <p>Unwilling to be a pawn of kings, and with a lingering distrust of the other Olympian gods after his many trials, Hercules decides to take matters into his own hands. He journeys to the battlefield and, in a moment of reckless desperation, calls upon the aid of Ares, the brutal and unpredictable god of war. Ares, a divine being who is more focused on bloodshed and chaos than strategy, answers the summons, but his help comes at a terrible price.</p>
